E-commerce web app build with Python, Django, SQLite, JQuery and JS

This Django project runs in the development mode and the below setup guide assumes that it will be run on local machine:

1. Create your virtual environment to install neccesary packages to run the project.
  - requirenments.txt included
  - I am using Anaconda to manage my virtual environment so installation command will look like that:
    conda create --name conda create --name myenv
