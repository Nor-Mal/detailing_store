# detailing_store
E-commerce web app created with Python, Django, JS and Bootstrap4 that integrates the following concepts:

 * usage of Django authentication system to handle the site access and user authorization â€“ extending User object with one-to-one model,
 * using Django ORM to perform CRUD operations on SQLite database,
 * usage of Signals to perform actions triggered by the user,
 * usage of Sessions to pass data between the views,
 * PayPal API integration to process payments.

This Django project runs in the development mode and the below setup guide assumes that it will be run on a local machine:

1. Create your virtual environment to install necessary packages to run the project
    `conda create --name yourenvname` - this will be a command to use if you are using Anaconda to manage your virtual environments 
2. Activate your virtual environment. 
    `conda activate yourenvname`
3. Install requried packages to run the project by using requirements.txt file.
    `conda install --file requirements.txt`
4. Install PayPal checkout server by typing:
    `pip install paypal-checkout-serversdk`dd
5. You will need to have Paypal sandbox account created to be able to set the below values.

6. Following setup would be needed in the project to be able to test the Paypal payments:
    - in the /detailing_store/settings.py file:<br/>
     `PAYPAL_RECEIVER_EMAIL = "Replace this text with your PayPal sandbox business email"`
    
    - in the detailing_store/shopping_basket/paypal.py file:<br/>
     `self.client_id = "Replace this text with your PayPal sandbox business CLIENT ID"`<br/>
     `self.client_secret = "Replace this text with your PayPal sandbox business CLIENT SECRET"`
     
    - in the shopping_basket/templates/shopping_basket/checkout.html file:<br/>
     `<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&currency=GBP&disable-funding=sofort"></script>`<br/>
     Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your PayPal sandbox client ID.
     
7. Now with your env active you should be able to successfully run the project by using usual django command:<br/>
    `python manage.py runserver`

8. Create admin user if you would like to have access to admin dashboard:
    `python manage.py createsuperuser`<br/>
    Standard users can be added by clicking Sign up button on the main page.

9. The database is preloaded with a 20 fake products so the migrations would not be needed.
